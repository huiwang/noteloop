# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help you preserve and review your valuable notes that you make while reading books. These notes often contain insightful moments, where you feel a connection with the author and find answers to your questions.

However, over time, these useful notes tend to get lost as you may forget to review them. This project aims to address this issue by creating a system that wakes up your dormant notes and assists you in reviewing them, ensuring that they become a part of your long-term memory.

# Solution
The solution involves extracting notes from your preferred reading platform, such as Kindle or WeRead, and inserting them into a review-friendly system. This review-friendly system could be Notion or any other similar platform that offers reminder features and ease of use.

The design principle of this project is to establish a common format for reading notes. Reader-specific adapters are created to transform reading notes into the common format. Finally, review-specific adapters are used to insert these notes into the target system.

# Why Go
While the system can be developed in any programming language, Go was chosen as the main language for this project to explore its capabilities and discover its potential.
